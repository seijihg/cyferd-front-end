# Cyferd

Here at Cyfered we are working together to build a NO-Code application builder. As a UI developer you will be working on the main platform builder but also the templates that the builder will create. The application will be built using React with Styled Components for styling. We are using atomic design principles to structure the applications and Storybook to document the components we create.

What we would like to see from you is how you would build an application using React, since we can't ask you to build the whole application, we would like to ask that you build a form:

### `Form fields:`

Name
Password
Password confirm
Date of birth
Age
Accept terms

### `Actions:`

Can only submit if all fields are valid
The result of the form to be logged in the console
A message to confirm the form has success fully submitted

### `Notes:`

We would like to see your UI skills so please do not use any framework or libraries like Bootstrap and Material design
We will be looking at how you execute this and not judging you on design
We understand this is an open-ended test, so please spend as much time you feel is needed to show us your UI developer skills
We will have an interview to discuss the test, so you will have an opportunity to talk us through what you have done, what you would have done better if you had more time, etc.
Please make sure that there is an element that shows us your skill as you would when developing for a production environment
